GCC is runs differently because the way the process is different. The macro processing can have a different output than the function because of the way they compile a program.

#2.7
Y is initialized by from the mac function, it's processed in a different way between the two macro and function processing. What it can do because of this is make the integer increase differently, earlier or later in the process.
